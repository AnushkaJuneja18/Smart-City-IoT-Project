# Problem Statement

Modern cities face challenges in managing safety, energy usage, traffic, and emergency risks. 
Traditional systems lack automation and real-time monitoring, leading to delays in response and 
resource wastage.

This project aims to simulate an IoT-enabled Smart City environment within Cisco Packet Tracer 
that integrates smart surveillance, automated street lighting, and fire detection mechanisms. 
The objective is to demonstrate how IoT sensors and network connectivity can improve city 
management, efficiency, and safety.
