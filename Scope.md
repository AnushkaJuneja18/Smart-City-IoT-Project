# Scope of the Solution

The scope of this project includes the following components:

## 1. Smart Surveillance System
- IP-based smart cameras connected through routers
- Motion detection alerts to the central server
- Real-time monitoring simulation in Packet Tracer

## 2. Intelligent Street Lighting
- Motion/Light sensors controlling street lamps
- Automatic ON/OFF functionality based on movement or time
- Reduced power consumption

## 3. Fire Monitoring System
- Smoke/temperature sensors installed in buildings
- Automatic alerts sent to the central monitoring server
